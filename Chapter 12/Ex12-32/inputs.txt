Wikis are enabled by wiki software
otherwise known as wiki engines
A wiki engine
being a form of a content management system
differs from other web-based systems such as blog software
in that the content is created without any defined owner or leader
and wikis have little inherent structure
allowing structure to emerge according to the needs of the users
There are dozens of different wiki engines in use
both standalone and part of other software
such as bug tracking systems
Some wiki engines are open-source
whereas others are proprietary
Some permit control over different functions
for example
editing rights may permit changing
adding
or removing material
Others may permit access without enforcing access control
Other rules may be imposed to organize content
